node-wp-api
===========

A Node.js-based client for the [WordPress JSON API](http://wp-api.org/)

## Documentation

We have automatically-generated API documentation at [kadamwhite.github.io/node-wp-api](http://kadamwhite.github.io/node-wp-api); user-oriented documentation (including a getting started guide) will be added to this README in (we hope) the near future.

The original working document describing our vision for the functionality of this library is [on this repository's wiki](https://github.com/kadamwhite/node-wp-api/wiki).
